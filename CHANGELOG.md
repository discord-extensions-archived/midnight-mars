Also for the person who put my theme into the Powercord theme links channel without my permission: can you dont? :WeirdChamp: ty in advance.

# v1.0.5
- Some optimizations (hopefully).
- Moved variables into compiled source instead of having it in the specific file. This only applies to BetterDiscord and Web. You may need to reinstall the theme if you're on one of these platforms.

# v1.0.4
Some general changes.
- Themed more things.
- New addition: Friends list now appears as a grid.
- Redid channel indicators.
- Some other small fixes / tweaking.

# v1.0.3
Themed more missed areas.

# v1.0.2
A few additions:
- Themed some missing things.
- Added custom HLJS styling for codeblocks as an addon.

# v1.0.1
Some small general changes:
- Themed multiple areas that I missed.
- Some changes to fix USRBG from stretching to all of the user popout & user modal. I also removed the imports from BD and Web as BDFDB already imports it on BD, and Web will never have support for it period. This closes [issue #2](https://github.com/LuckFire/midnight-mars/issues/2).

# v1.0.0
Inital release, hope you enjoy!
- Pleaes note that as this is the first release, there will most likely be issues with the theme. If you notice anything wrong with it, please make an issue describing what's wrong.
